## Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are a major global health concern, responsible for millions of deaths annually. This project aims to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases using machine learning models, providing a more affordable and convenient alternative to traditional diagnostic methods.

### Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases are often undetected due to the prohibitive costs of diagnostic tests, leading to delayed treatments. This project addresses this issue by developing models that predict cardiovascular diseases based on patient data.

### How AI/ML Solves the Problem

Using a dataset of 70,000 patients, this project employs various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, KNN, and XGBoost, to build predictive models. The data includes objective features (age, height, weight, gender), examination features (blood pressure, cholesterol level, glucose level), and lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity).

## Project Details

### Preprocessing

The dataset was normalized and balanced, ensuring fair representation of patients with and without cardiovascular diseases. Key features like gender, smoking, and cholesterol levels were analyzed using bar graphs to understand their impact.

### Model Building

Five different models were implemented and optimized using grid search and random search. The models' performance was evaluated using accuracy and AUC ROC scores. Decision tree was chosen for further analysis, including testing gender-based datasets.

### Additional Models

1. **Neural Network (PyTorch):**
   - Implemented a neural network using PyTorch to improve accuracy scores. Explored various layers and loss functions for optimization.
  
2. **Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering):**
   - Utilized the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters. Trained the model using the decision tree, but accuracy scores showed no significant changes.

### Project Outcomes

The project achieved approximately 72% accuracy using models such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, KNN, XGBoost, and PyTorch. Systolic blood pressure emerged as the most important feature correlated with cardiovascular diseases.

### Insights and Conclusions

- **Gender:** Contrary to initial hypotheses, gender did not significantly impact accuracy scores in predicting cardiovascular diseases.
  
- **BMI:** While height and weight were not direct indicators, BMI emerged as an essential feature correlating with cardiovascular diseases.

## Impact of the LSI Program

Participating in the LSI program provided valuable insights into deep learning frameworks, including neural networks and unsupervised learning techniques. The mentor's guidance enhanced the project's organization and effectiveness, facilitating the development of reusable Python functions.
